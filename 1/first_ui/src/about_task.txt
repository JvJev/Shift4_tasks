Technologies: react ; CSS ; NPM ; chatGPT ; google chrome web console ; 

Work time in total: ~20-30 hours

Workflow:
1. (atempt 1)
Created visual UI with logic in mind to build components "from top to bottom".
Navigations bars have minimal visual effects click and hoover. 
What was possible generated components with chatGPT. Idea was to render same components with different data. Acheved result with document components.
Cards components became too complicated, so reworked them.
2. (atempt 2)
Reworked all cards components individually. Visuals are "hardcoded" and nothing is dynamicaly rendered.
After main structure of the page done all CSS detailing completed.

Main challenges:
1. Keep the main structure and correct allignement of all components.
2. Rework navBars correctly in flexbox.
3. CSS hell.
